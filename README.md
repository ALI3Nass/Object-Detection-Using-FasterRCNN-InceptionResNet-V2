## Overview

Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and locating objects within an image. This code uses TensorFlow and a pre-trained model from TensorFlow Hub to perform object detection.

## Requirements

- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Hub
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

## Getting Started

  1. Clone the repository:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/ALI3Nass/Object-Detection-Using-FasterRCNN-InceptionResNet-V2.git

  2. Install the required dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install tensorflow tensorflow-hub matplotlib pillow

## Usage 

- Modify the script to specify your image URLs or other configurations as needed.
- Run the script to perform object detection on the specified images.
